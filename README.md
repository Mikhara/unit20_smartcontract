## Level 1 - Associate Profit Splitter

The level 1 Associate Profit Splitter works by accepting Ether into the contract then evenly dividing it among three employees. With the conditions of how much each employee should be paid already agreed upon, this contract can be deployed efficiently and quickly.

This is the purpose/motivation of smart contracts, to remove unnecessary intermediaries, in a transparent, accurate way. When the agreed preconditions are met, such as each employee to be paid equally, the contract (code) is executed on the blockchain. Some other notable benefits are:

* Speed - live contract that can be executed automatically;
* Security - data encryption and transparency by being run using blockchain;
* Cost efficient - removes expensive intermediaries like litigation lawyers!
